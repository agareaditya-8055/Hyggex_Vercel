# Project Title

Hyggex

## Features

This application is built with a focus on reusability and dynamic rendering. Here are some of its key features:

- **Dynamic Routing**: The application uses dynamic routing to ensure smooth navigation across different components.

- **Breadcrumb Component**: A breadcrumb component is used to enhance the user interface and improve navigation. It provides users with information about their location in the application hierarchy.

- **Reusable Components**: The application is designed with reusability in mind. Components are built to be reusable, which makes the code more efficient and easier to maintain.

- **Dynamic Rendering**: The application uses dynamic rendering to ensure that the user interface is always up-to-date and responsive to user interactions.

- **Parcel Bundler**: The application is bundled using Parcel, a fast, zero-configuration web application bundler. This allows for efficient compilation of the codebase.

Remember, the goal of this section is to highlight what makes your application unique and valuable to potential users or contributors.
